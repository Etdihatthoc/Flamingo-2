Your task is to evaluate a candidate's spoken response based on the provided audio and transcript.

*Evaluation Criteria
    Assess the candidate's performance in five categories:

    1. Grammar (Range and Control)
        Band 0: Test taker is not present.
        Band 1: Performance does not satisfy band 2 descriptors.
        Band 2: Shows only limited control of a few simple grammatical structures and sentence patterns in a learned repertoire.
        Band 3: Uses some simple structures correctly but still systematically makes basic mistakes. However, he/she can manage to make himself/herself understood.
        Band 4: Uses relatively accurately frequently-used simple structures. Some errors occur, but he/she can make himself/herself easily understood.

5. Transcript:  Today I will talk about Facebook and the advantages of Facebook and also the disadvantages of Facebook. People say that Facebook is a useful learning tool for students. It has many arguments for this purpose. First, Facebook is a means of entertainment so all the people can connect to their accounts and communicate with other people in the distance. Secondly, it is also a different way to learn because Facebook provides many online courses. You can follow the online courses in the famous ancient sources and do the courses yourself. Finally, it has a rich source of information because the internet has a huge source of information all around the world. You can connect to all kinds of journals, books and scientific publications. Facebook is also a method to communicate the people to each other. It helps people to find their friends and family members instead of missing. To sum up, Facebook is a very useful tool not only for students to study but for all the people in their daily life. However, besides the positive effects, there are also many negative effects of Facebook. First, it may bring false information to the audience. For example, many children follow the influencers and do the same thing. It is very dangerous. Secondly, people can lose the information.

6. Transcript:  Okay, the most popular exercise in our country is football. Yes, because most Vietnamese love football. You can see in every match of our country or other popular country, many people attend to big screen or watch football match. However, the title sign I think people continue to do in future in my country is walking. Yes, not football. Because football at this time in my country is expensive to have enough space for 22 people to play. Yes, and in contrast, walking is cheap. You only buy your shoes to walk and it requires not much space like football. Last but not least, you can understand that if the weather is so bad, you cannot play football outside. But with walking, you can stay at home and run or walk. Why? You just buy a machine to help you walk at your home. And you are also the sport in the Olympic Games for walking and I strongly believe that our country might get the best result in such Olympic Games. I think physical education may be increased at old school level because I strongly believe Yes, our physical education in Vietnam is nothing to compare to some countries like Japan, United States or British states. You can see in Japan, every month, children must join a racing game to run about 5 km each month regardless of weather. Snow or rain or something like this. They don't care. They must run. And when we increase the physical education, it means that we could see our football team or another team get a higher ranking all over the world. You can see some countries have a heavy education in physical education. In Japan, now their football team is at rank 32. They are usually available in the World Cup unlike our country. Another reason is that physical education will help us to have a powerful army to protect our country. A healthy population means that we will end up strong to protect ourselves from any disaster of the weather. In a world like this, global climate change affects our environment. In the next flood, we have enough powerful time to run for waiting for the government to be killed.

7. Transcript:  So I'm going to talk about how Facebook is a useful tool for students. So as we may know that Facebook is a very popular social networking site. And to the young people, they can provide great help. So the first thing that, the first benefit of Facebook is that it can provide a rich source of information. So by following the pages on Facebook, the people can, the students can get like information pop up on their news feed every day. And those pieces of information are delivered in bite signs, which means that it's not too long. So the students may find it easier to take in the information in contrast to long lectures that they find on the videos on other platforms. And also it can provide a different way of learning for people on Facebook can create different kind of groups. And in those groups, they can share information with each other. They can share the tips for starting or they can share different resources. And it can also be a means of entertainment after a long period of time spent for starting. The students can go on Facebook and watch funny videos or they can talk with their friends or they can comment on their friends' photos. So I think that all of Facebook is a tool that can be very effective for students. So talking about some of the following follow up questions here. So what are the negative influences of Facebook? So one thing that people usually talk about is that social media, especially like Facebook, can cause addiction. And people tend to scroll continuously without noticing the time. And that would be very time consuming and it would take a lot of time away from productive activities. Another problem that Facebook may have is that it provides videos and posts that require shorter attention from the users. So the user will tend to just read the short posts and short videos. So they may find it harder to concentrate if they have to engage with a more difficult task that requires a longer period of time. So the second question is that definitely the number of Facebook users have changed over the last 10 years in my country. So as I remember 10 years ago, people tend to use another platform like Yahoo. But within these maybe 5 years, the number of Facebook users increased significantly.

8. Transcript:  Yeah, as you may know, there's a tendency that almost everyone will go to college, but the tuition in college is very high, are very high these days, which prevents a part of the generation from getting higher education. So there is a statement that higher education should be free to everyone. I completely agree with this statement for the following reasons. The first reason is free higher education would create an equal chance for everyone. We all know that people, students from poor families, couldn't afford to do their further education and they have to start work very early to support for themselves. So if they were given the opportunities to receive the higher education, it is more likely that they could get the chance to enjoy the free education from the government. Another reason is free higher education should be a solution to employment. We all know that the job market is very competitive these days and it is more and more difficult for everyone to find a good and stable job. So if you have a better qualification, you surely have a better job and as a result, you could get higher salary and you could support your family better. Another reason why higher education should be free to everyone is that it will create a better advancement in technology. As you know that nowadays even we have a lot of workers, we still need a high quality workforce who work in the technological sector. And these employees will surely make a lot of great inventions to the society and they will have to boost up the economy and raise the living standards of everyone, of all the people in the society. I think it is reasonable to apply free higher education in Vietnam because it is equal chance for everyone and if the government has very clear procedure on how to apply it, the young people can easily get the opportunities successfully. I don't agree that university is the only way to success because we have a lot of workers who work in factories and they somehow contribute their part to the development of the society and they still have a very good job with a stable income to support their family. The lower level of education should be free to everyone. I think it is true for sure because the children need to learn how to...
